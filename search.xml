    <content><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I am Ju Lin, an undergraduate student and the creator of this personal website. I am thrilled to officially launch my platform and start sharing my experiences, thoughts, and interests with you all.</p>
<p>However, I want to let you know that this website is still a work in progress and there may be some areas that are under construction. I appreciate your understanding and patience as I continue to develop and improve my site.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ll be posting updates about my studies, hobbies, and any other projects I’m working on. I hope to provide a glimpse into my life and to share my journey with those who are interested.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or requests for content that you’d like to see on my site, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me via ju@julin.org. I’m always open to feedback and new ideas.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy what I have to offer.</p>
