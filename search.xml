    <content><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I am Ju Lin, an undergraduate student and the creator of this personal website. I am thrilled to officially launch my platform and start sharing my experiences, thoughts, and interests with you all.</p>
<p>It is always my dream to own a personal portfolio website with my name as domain. However, I want to let you know that this website is still a work in progress and there may be some areas that are under construction. I appreciate your understanding and patience as I continue to develop and improve my site.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will be posting updates about my studies, hobbies, and any other projects I am working on. I hope to provide a glimpse into my life and to share my journey with those who are interested.</p>
<p>I am currently doing a undergraduate research about navigation which will be introduced in a conference in mid May, and a powertrain engineer in PolyU E-Formula Team who will attend FSUK in JUly. Needless to mention my course work, I am not having much time to update and maintain this website until the semester ends.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions or requests for content that you would like to see on my site, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via ju@julin.org. I am always open to feedback and new ideas.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy everything so far.</p>
